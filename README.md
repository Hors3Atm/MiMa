# MiMa

This is a website that is created for a school project. I get a grade for this.
I learn HTML and CSS, and maybe in the future, JavaScript on this thing
This is important to me, not because it is created for a company, but because it looks better already than my first webpage.
This is it for the day of the creation of this repo.
